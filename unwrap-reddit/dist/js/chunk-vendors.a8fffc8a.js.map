Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.

To listen for new thread updates, simply\nadd listeners to that emitter.\n\nThe following events can be emitted:\n- `update`: Occurs when a new update has been posted in this thread. Emits a `LiveUpdate` object containing information\nabout the new update.\n- `activity`: Occurs periodically when the viewer count for this thread changes.\n- `settings`: Occurs when the thread's settings change. Emits an object containing the new settings.\n- `delete`: Occurs when an update has been deleted. Emits the ID of the deleted update.\n- `strike`: Occurs when an update has been striken (marked incorrect and crossed out). Emits the ID of the striken update.\n- `embeds_ready`: Occurs when embedded media is now available for a previously-posted update.\n- `complete`: Occurs when this LiveThread has been marked as complete, and no more updates will be sent.\n\n(Note: These event types are mapped directly from reddit's categorization of the updates.

It will also have a few additional properties such as `scope` (an array of scope strings)\n and `ratelimitRemaining` (the number of requests remaining for the current 10-minute interval, in compliance with reddit's\n [API rules](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API).)

You will need to get the refresh token from reddit\n   beforehand. A script to automatically generate refresh tokens for you can be found\n   [here](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper).\n   * 1. *Username/password*: To authenticate with a username and password, pass an object with the properties `userAgent`,\n   `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `username`, and `password` to the snoowrap constructor. Note that username/password\n   authentication is only possible for `script`-type apps.\n   * 1. *Access token*: To authenticate with an access token, pass an object with the properties `userAgent` and `accessToken`\n   to the snoowrap constructor. Note that all access tokens expire one hour after being generated, so this method is\n   not recommended for long-term use.\n   * @param {object} options An object containing authentication options. This should always have the property `userAgent`. It\n   must also contain some combination of credentials (see above)\n   * @param {string} options.userAgent A unique description of what your app does. This argument is not necessary when snoowrap\n   is running in a browser.\n   * @param {string} [options.clientId] The client ID of your app (assigned by reddit)\n   * @param {string} [options.clientSecret] The client secret of your app (assigned by reddit).
